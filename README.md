## About Laravel

Evaluation application developed to TSJM.

# Modules
We have a randomize algorithm that give aleatory question to every judge, all the judges gonna have a different question and answer. To avoid the possible security questions, the exam is evaluated by question and answers slugs.
Every response is saved when clicking in the checkbox.
When a judge ends the exam, the administrator could download all their exam, including answers.
Also, when a judge ends, the administrator could download a diploma where validate their participation that includes their score.
The administrator has a dashboard with traffic light scheme (green, yellow and red).
